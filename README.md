# number-theory
Programmatically implementing some Number Theory things :wink:

## motivation
Here I've tried addressing some number theory problems, which I encountered in a basic Number-Theory Book. I'll keep adding problems & solutions which I'll be able to programmatically implement. And I'm planning to stick to GoLang as language of implementation.

**Consider watching this repo, for more updates** :wink:
